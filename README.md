👋 I’m Euris (aarhuuus). A full-stack developer that relies on StackOverflow and coffee ☕ \
👀 I’m interested in making things that are functional and useful (for me or others) \
🌱 I’m currently learning `JavaScript, Rust, and Handlebars` and much more at the moment. \
🏵 I'm currently planning to self-learn these languages as they peaked my interest
